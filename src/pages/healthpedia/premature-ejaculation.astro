        "Premature ejaculation occurs in men when semen leave the body (ejaculate) sooner than wanted during sex. Premature ejaculation is a common sexual complaint. As many as 1 out of 3 people say they have it at some time."} body2={"Premature ejaculation isn't cause for concern if it doesn't happen often. But you might be diagnosed with premature ejaculation if you: always or nearly always ejaculate within 1 to 3 minutes of penetration, are not able to delay ejaculation during sex all or nearly all the time, feel distressed and frustrated, and tend to avoid sexual intimacy as a result. Premature ejaculation is a treatable condition. Medications, counseling and techniques that delay ejaculation can help improve sex for you and your partner."}/>
