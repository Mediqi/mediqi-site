> ## When you choose healthy behaviors, you can lower your heart disease risk while also preventing other serious chronic conditions like type 2 diabetes and some kinds of cancer

### Learn Your Health History

Know your risks and talk to your family and doctor about your health history.

### Eat a Healthy Diet

Make healthy food choices like more fruits, vegetables, whole grains, lean meats, and low-fat
dairy products. Eat less salt, saturated fat, and added sugar.

### Move More, Sit Less

Get at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity aerobic activity every week, plus muscle-strengthening activities at least 2 days a week

### Take Medicines as Directed

If you take medicine to treat high cholesterol, high blood pressure, or diabetes, follow your doctor’s instructions carefully. Always ask questions if you don’t understand something. Never stop taking your medicine without talking to your doctor, nurse, or pharmacist.

### Choose Your Drinks Wisely

Substitute water for sugary drinks to reduce calories. If you drink alcohol, do so in moderation by limiting consumption to no more than 1 drink a day for women (2 for men) on days that alcohol is consumed.

### Monitor Your Blood Pressure at Home

Self-measured blood pressure monitors are easy and safe to use, and your doctor can show you how to use one if you need help.
