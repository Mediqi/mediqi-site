There are plenty of supplements and products claiming to help boost immunity. But supporting a healthy immune system is more complicated than taking a mix of vitamins and minerals packaged into a pill or powder.

Your immune system operates in a very delicate balance. It must be strong and sophisticated enough to fight off a variety of illnesses and infections, but not so strong that it overreacts unnecessarily.

To achieve this, it's very tightly controlled by many inputs and in response to what's happening inside of your body.

Like we said, complex.

From fighting off a cold to the flu to COVID-19, there are things you can do to help give your immune system what it needs to function optimally, though. None of which involve taking a supplement.

Here are six science-backed ways to build and maintain a strong, healthy immune system:

## 1. Stay up-to-date on recommended vaccines
A strong immune system means taking advantage of the best leg up we have to protect ourselves from harmful illnesses: vaccines.

Your immune system is smart, but vaccines train it to be even smarter — helping it learn how to recognize and fight off certain disease-causing illnesses. It's much safer for your immune system to learn via vaccination than through infection with these harmful germs.

## 2. Maintain a healthy diet
As with most things in your body, a healthy diet is key to a strong immune system. This means making sure you eat plenty of vegetables, fruits, legumes, whole grains, lean proteins and healthy fats.

>“When your body has sufficient amounts of the micronutrients found in these foods, it helps to maintain your immune system homeostasis,” adds Dr. Lin.

These micronutrients include:

- Vitamin B6, found in chicken, salmon, tuna, bananas, green vegetables and potatoes (with the skin)
- Vitamin C, found in citrus fruit, including oranges and strawberries, as well as tomatoes, broccoli and spinach
- Vitamin E, found in almonds, sunflower and safflower oil, sunflower seeds, peanut butter and spinach
- Zinc, found in oysters, red meat, poultry, beans, dairy products
- Magnesium, found in whole wheat products, nuts, seeds
